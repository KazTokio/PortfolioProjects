# Insights
# 1. Improved Life Expectancy
#    - Comparing data from 1960 and 2020, life expectancy has improved significantly, 
#      especially in low-income and developing countries.
#    - For example, in many sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries, 
#      life expectancy has increased by more than 20 years.
#    - Advances in medical technology, widespread vaccination, and improved infectious 
#      disease control are thought to be the main factors.

# 2. Declining Birth Rates
#    - In many developed countries, fertility rates were significantly lower in 2020 than in 1960.
#    - In some cases, particularly in European and North American countries, 
#      fertility rates have decreased to half.
#    - This may be due to higher levels of education for women, increased labour market 
#      participation, greater economic stability, and improved access to family planning.

# 3. Regional Differences
#    - Scatter plots show that there are significant differences in patterns of life expectancy 
#      and fertility across regions, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and the USA.
#    - High-income countries (e.g., Europe, North America) tend to have higher life expectancies 
#      and lower fertility rates.
#    - Low-income countries (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa) tend to have relatively low life expectancy 
#      values and high fertility rates.

# 4. Changes Over Time
#    - Between 1960 and 2020, economic and social development has contributed to higher life expectancy 
#      in certain countries and regions.
#    - For example, countries with rapid economic growth, such as China and India, show a significant 
#      increase in life expectancy.
#    - This change can be attributed to increased political stability, changes in economic policy, 
#      and increased investment in education and healthcare.
